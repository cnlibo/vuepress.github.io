Furnace designs vary as to its function, heating duty, type of fuel and method of introducing combustion air. Heat is generated by an industrial furnace by mixing fuel with air or oxygen, or from electrical energy. The residual heat will exit the furnace as flue gas.[1] These are designed as per international codes and standards the most common of which are ISO 13705 (Petroleum and natural gas industries — Fired heaters for general refinery service) / American Petroleum Institute (API) Standard 560 (Fired Heater for General Refinery Service).
